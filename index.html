        <h2>The Vision</h2>
        <p>
            At Stepped, we dream of a world where everyone has the opportunity to invest in property—no matter where they come from or how much they start with.
        </p>
        <p>
            For far too long, the property ladder has felt like a distant goal for many, an exclusive space reserved for the few. We’re here to change that. Our mission is to break down barriers, create pathways, and open doors to a future where property investment is within reach for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            We’re driven by more than just numbers. We’re driven by the stories of individuals striving for financial freedom, families longing for stability, and communities yearning for growth. At the heart of everything we do is a commitment to tackle inequality and provide tools that empower people to build wealth and transform their futures.
        </p>
        <p>
            Together, we’re reimagining what’s possible in property investment—creating a fairer, more inclusive world, one step at a time.
